# 💧 Jerusalem Water Supply Analysis

This project analyzes measurements of water flowing into various **water facilities in Jerusalem**, with the goal of supporting engineering decisions through clear **data visualizations** and **statistical insights**.

Developed for the **lead water resources engineer**, this tool helps evaluate flow behavior, detect patterns, and guide operational planning based on real-world data from multiple facility locations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📥 **Ingest** and process water flow data collected from multiple supply stations in Jerusalem.
- 📊 **Visualize** water flow over time — daily, monthly, and per location.
- 📆 **Compare water behavior** across weekdays (e.g., Monday vs. Saturday) and weekend windows.
- 📤 **Export actionable insights** to Excel reports with embedded graphs for stakeholders and engineers.

## 🧠 Key Features

### `Jerusalem_water_supply.py`:
- Reads Excel files from multiple Jerusalem water facilities.
- Smooths and plots water flow over time.
- Generates:
  - Full timeline plots
  - Monthly plots
  - Individual location plots
  - Four "Thursday–Saturday" operational windows
- Outputs all graphs to a **single Excel report**.

### `mon_vs_sat.py`:
- Aggregates and compares water levels for **Mondays vs. Saturdays**.
- Calculates:
  - Overall and daytime averages
  - Monthly breakdowns
  - Hourly patterns
- Exports the analysis to **Excel with visuals and stats**.
- Prints summary of percentage differences between weekdays.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- `pandas` for data cleaning and analysis  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations  
- `openpyxl` for exporting graphs into Excel files  
- Python 3.8+

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

## 📈 Output Highlights

- Water flow graphs over time for all locations
- Separate monthly visualizations
- Statistical comparison of weekdays (Monday vs. Saturday)
- Operational window (Thursday–Saturday) flow snapshots
- Excel reports (.xlsx) with embedded visuals for engineer review

## 🧪 Example Use Case

The lead engineer at a Jerusalem water resource firm can use this project to:

- Understand facility-specific behavior over time
- Compare weekdays vs. weekends for maintenance planning
- Identify anomalies or irregularities before they escalate
- Present visual summaries to municipalities or contractors
