# Data Analysis & Automation â€“ Water Resource Management

**Amit Geller**

This repository showcases my work as a Data Analysis & Automation Support Specialist at Yaron Geller - Planning & Management of Water Resources. The repo contains Python projects and scripts designed to analyze real-world water supply data, automate data preparation, and produce clear, decision-support visualizations for engineers.

## About the Work

- Retrieve live project data (CSV/Excel) from the water industry (facility inflows, water levels, supply monitoring, etc)
- Automate data processing and analysis workflows
- Generate engineering reports and visualizations
- Support infrastructure planning and water resource management decisions
